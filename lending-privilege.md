# LENDING PRIVILEGE

- Tech inclusion pledge
- Move from diversity to inclusion and empath
	- Diversity: inviting everyone to the party (too easy to checkbox)
	- Inclusion, empathy: making sure everyone feels comfortable at the party
- Moving away from diversity towards inclusion
- Actual value to inclusion:
	- **Inclusive** teams are **innovative** teams
- Inclusion is at the heart of open source
	- The cathedral and the bazaar (Eric S. Raymond)
		- The miracle that is Linux
		- *Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow*
		- *Given enough large beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone*  — is a statement of inclusion
- Often our companies *are protected by privilege*
	- Access denied
- What privilege is not
	- Doesn’t mean you haven’t:
		- Worked hard, sacrificed, not good at what you do
- Privilege
	- Is like riding a bike up a hill
- People without privilege have other obstacles for getting up that hill
- With privilege, things are a little easier for you
- Privilege == access to benefits based on things that you have
- Birth privileges are root of most biases, prejudices
- Selective privileges, things that you choose
	- School, religion, gender identity
- Of our nature to share our privilege with people who have that privilege (gender, racial)
- **More powerful to share privilege with people who do not have that privilege**
- Portfolio of privilege
	- Parental, racial, education, religion, physical, gender
	- Pick one that you have… What would you career in tech be without that privilege?
	- Now think, there are people you work with every day who have to navigate the tech scene without this privilege
- Having a more inclusive industry benefits everyone
	- Marginalization is on the way out:
		- The Panama Papers
		- Class privilege is over
- Credibility lending
	- LGBT feel invisible, not recognized.
	- Fix: credibility lending
	- E.g. raise someone’s profile within your company, who does not share some of your privilege(s)
- Access lending
	- E.g. you have access to things based on your privilege (such as invitation to speak at an event), lend that access
- Expertise lending
	- Someone who feels they don’t have a voice, lacking leaders in tech industry with their background
	- SxSW, Michelle Obama: If you have a voice at the table, ask if there is diversity at the table, are there voices that don’t sound like yours? 
	- E.g. give someone the opportunity to lead at your company
- Your turn to lend
- Lending privilege:
	- Not a silver bullet
	- Needs to be **a philosophy of life**
	- Need to believe in the **benefit of inclusion**: **innovation**
	- Not a sprint, a marathon, need to do it every day. This is the only way we can truly get change in this industry.
