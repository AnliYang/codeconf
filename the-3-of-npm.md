# THE <3 OF NPM

Stephanie Snopek, support at NPM

- Stephanie has NPM stickers :sparkle: :heart:
- **What is NPM**
	- **Not** node package manager :open_mouth:
	- Doesn’t actually stand for anything **lol**
- **Numbers**
	- 4 millions developers, thousands of companies
	- 1 billion downloads/week
	- == human interactions :smile:
- Support: tweets, tickets, issues
- *Socks for docs* :tada:
- Intentional communication
	- The successful conveying or sharing of ideas and feelings
	- Means of connecting between people or places
	- “soft skills”, easy to dismiss
	- Not easy to communicate, not easy to get points across meaningfully
- Streamlined communication strategies
	- Flex your empathy, put yourself in your user’s shoes
		- When in doubt, use emoji
	- Don’t take it personally. The issue is rarely about you
	- Get comfortable with conflict, conflict is inevitable
	- Don’t feed the frustration (*don’t poke the bear*)
		- Don’t tell people to calm down lol
		- Validate, acknowledge they’ve been heard
	- Ask questions, don’t assume you know what’s going on
	- Take breaks, slow down, “that’s really interesting, I’ll get back to you with more info asap”
	- Apologize, genuinely, without expectation
- Communication = connection = community
- Support your support team. Rewarding, but challenging, requires *a ton of emotional labor*
- npm :heart: you
