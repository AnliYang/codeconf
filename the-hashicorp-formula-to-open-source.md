# THE HASHICORP FORMULA TO OPEN SOURCE

MITCHELL HASHIMOTO, @mitchellh
Creator of Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, and more

- **Background**
- :heart: OSS
- Idols, open source:
	- Katz, Resig, DHH
- Started *doing* OSS, 2006
	- Building mods for open source forum software
	- In 2013, top contributor to OSS according to GitHub report
- Founded Hashicorp
	- All open source projects have > 1500 stars on GitHub, one has > 12000 stars :boom:
	- Measure of usage, interest
- Success how?
	- One time: chance, two times: coincidence, three times: pattern, more than this? **Formulaic**.
- What steps? What formula?
- :star: You can do it too
- Before the formula… Back to 2007
	- *Mac specialist*, :apple: retail
	- Formative period, in terms of how to build software, communities
	- Lessons:
		- Look and feel matters
			- iPhone alignment
		- Design for humans
		- Be welcoming, kind :smile:
			- Most people want to be nice, and are genuinely kind
			- If someone’s not nice, they usually have a reason, you would feel the same in their shoes
			- How to approach meanness, **useful for open source**
- And now… **The Formula for Open Source**
	- **Find a problem** (at least one of: time, money, errors (and *fun*))
		- Vagrant: time and errors
		- Deeply appreciate, understand. Go and experience the pain. Not that painful, maybe don’t solve for it.
		- Understand: Who else has tried to fix? Why is my idea better? What are the risks? 
		- 10x, aim for order of magnitude… Be 10x better than anything else out there, to overcome cost of replacement. At least 3x. Be significantly better to overcome the *good enough* incumbent.
	- **Design a solution**
		- Don’t write code yet
		- Write human language
			- Cover the why, the what
			- Design, in words, the *front-end* and *back-end* at the same time
				- Back-end: internals, technical details
				- Front-end: anything user facing. the terminal, yes!
					- Nice errors, fun, intuitive, human interaction element, design for people
					- *Playtest* the front-end, i.e. mock it, make it look like’s it done, but just a shell, so you can interact with it, improve the interface. Assume you can engineer the back-end, but get the front-end right.
	- **Build a 0.1**
		- Code! `< />` :smile:
		- 3-6 months, regardless of bandwidth (full-time, part-time)
		- Focus on primary use case, guard the bugs through human-friendly errors
		- 0.1 a path to a 1.0, set the direction
		- Follow the design :exclamation:, adjust if needed (this is normal :smile:)
		- Code as craft, care about the code, treat it as a craft, write tests, 0.1 code rarely changes
	- **Documentation**
		- Not just a README, yes do this. Also: make real docs. Because designing for humans.
		- Code, for machines. Now invest in docs for humans. Humans will not *talk to the code*.
		- Documentation != landing page
		- Human ordering, not alphabetical. Order intuitively, like a journey. Beginners want the journey, advanced users know where to go.
		- Repeat yourself. Counterintuitive to programmers (DRY). Harder to maintain, but a much nicer experience.
		- Plan for a full week for documentation. But pays off, lasts forever.
	- **Landing page**
		- Marketing focus:
			- What it is, why it is, how do I use it, how do I get involved
		- Look and feel matters
		- Common look and feel across all Hashicorp landing pages
	- **Ship** :ship: :shipit: :tada:
		- Think about the 0.2, clean up, ship features that slipped
		- 0.3 to 0.5, Hashicorp aims production-ready
		- If you build it they will come not necessarily true. Promote through public speaking, meet ups, conferences, get creative with funds
		- Community.
			- Be kind, be helpful, be welcoming. All the time. Otherwise, remove yourself from the situation. Step away.
			- Negative people will come.
