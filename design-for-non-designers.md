Tracy Osborn, @limedaring

- **Background**:
	- *Wedding lovely*
	- Learnt Python, Django
	- Insight into state of programming tutorials…
	- …led to book series: Hello Web App
- **Now**…
	- How to teach design to programmers
	- Just enough design to create better interfaces
- Tips
	- Clutter
		- Cut down on it == fastest way to better design
		- Widget
		- Grid == lining things up, misalignment looks like clutter
		- Bootstrap grid
	- Color
		- Complimentary
		- Mostly neutral, + 1 brighter
		- Smashing Magazine article
		- :boom: **HACK**: colourlovers.com :gb:
	- Fonts
		- No more than 2 per website
		- Cleaner fonts to avoid clutter
		- Vary weights
		- **HACK**: beautiful web type, typewolf
	- Other ways to reduce clutter
		- Whitespace! Less :arrow_down: is more :arrow_up:
			- Hacker news needs more
			- NYT redesign, more whitespace between columns
			- Can help site perform better
	- **TL;DR Reduce visual clutter**:
		- No. fonts, colors low, add whitespace, line things up
	- User experience guidelines
		- Make it easy to find and use primary action
			- Brighter colors for primary action
		- Pay attention to your goals, use analytics
	- Content
		- People don’t read on the web, they skim
		- Break big paragraphs into bullets
		- Bold them important bits
		- Add whitespace
	- Headlines
		- Short, concise, focus on benefits not details
		- Natural, friendly. Don’t talk like a :robot:
		- Again, helps with conversion rates :chart_with_upwards_trend:
	- Philosophy
		- Good artists copy, great artists **steal**
		- *Not sure if I’m a good developer or just great at Googling* :laughing:
		- Find a design you like, try to pick out what they’re doing well, train your *design mind*
	- Thought process:
		- “crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap … **yesssss!**” :laughing:
		- Not a bad designer… simply a designer :heart:
	- This :point_up: is just the start :boom:
		- Practice, practice, practice
