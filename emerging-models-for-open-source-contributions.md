# EMERGING MODELS FOR OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS

**Nadia Eghbal**, @nayafia
- Doing research around open source activity
- Evolution of open source contributions
- Different models, emerged over time
- Brief history of different models for managing open source contributions
- What the future holds
- Different models for different *market* needs
	- Markets: users, contributors
- History
	- **BDFL** prevalent (Benevolent Dictator for Life, Linux, Python)
		- Anyone can have their say, but 1 person (BD) has final say
		- Made sense when the market was smaller
		- Open source was a counter-culture, alternative
		- Harder to code, fewer contributors
		- BDFL benefits:
			- Centralized leadership, governance
			- Centralized roadmap, direction
		- Drawbacks:
			- Less democratic
			- Best you can hope for is influence
			- BDFL made companies nervous, both contributing and using
				- Arbitrary decisions made by someone outside of *our control*
	- **Meritocracy** (Apache Software Foundation, 1999)
		- Multiple *actors* weighing in
		- Anyone with merit can make contributions, can have a binding vote
		- :+1: Great for company buy-in, path for participation
		- Apache helped with legal protections, creating a neutral *safe space*
		- Partially why open source has been successful
		- Still some friction:
			- *with merit, what does this mean? how is it achieved?
			- From ASF: people have to *earn the right*
				- Commitment, care, work well with others (not going to rock the boat)
			- You need to prove yourself, by spending time on the project
		- Makes sense *in theory*, but…
			- Favors people who can *pay to play* (people with time)
			- E.g. companies who can devote full time contributors have more weight, say in process
	- **Liberal contribution** (Node.js, 2010s)
		- More users, tech, talent than ever before
		- Git, GitHub made this easier for anyone to *jump in*
		- Common interface, pattern, for contributing
		- 49% of ppl on top GitHub projects only contributed once :open_mouth:
		- More **NOISE**, under meritocracy this was bad :-1:
		- But, opportunity! Engagement! Harness! Redirect!
			- CLA requirement? Can we drop it?
			- Node adopted a liberal contribution policy (*Getting people to contribute is hard, Git is good at removing things* — Mikel Rogers, Node.js)
		- Results:
			- Waaaaaay more contributions :chart_with_upwards_trend:
			- Free marketing, WOM (word of mouth) ambassadors
				- Nodeschool
			- New perspectives, skills, backgrounds (inclusion)
				- *People need to be enabled to do good work* — Mikel Rogers
		- Also, **Rust** adopting this contribution model
			- Originally used BDFL -> core team -> federated structure
			- 1200+ contributors, contributing regularly
			- *diverse range of perspectives in both design and decision-making* — Alex Crichton, Rust
			- Care about end-user perspective
	- **Liberal contribution models**:
		- Floodgates, not bottlenecks
			- Ultimately less work for maintainer, although counterintuitive
		- Consensus seeking (focus on major concerns), rather than consensus
			- Once there are no more *major issues*, we’re :cool:?
			- Emphasize discussion
		- Meet contributors where they are
			- Value of good docs, contribution guides, tagging beginner bugs
		- Default to yes
			- Here’s what I need from you in order to be able to accept
- **Do BDFLs still matter?**
	- Yes, early in life of project. Central person important
	- BDFL can help incubate, set direction
	- Like starting a company
	- Liberal contributions can help with managing growth
	- *Project trajectory chart* :chart_with_upwards_trend:
	- Move towards liberal contributions as project matures, grows
- Case study:
	- Django, Jacon Kaplan-Moss (*…I realize our community doesn’t need [BDFLs]*)
- Modern projects using BDFL?
	- Clojure: 1 person making vast majority of contributions
	- Works because Clojure is sustainably supported (by Cognitect), and everyone is happy with the situation :smile:
- BDFL as a long-term strategy, requires luck (find a company to hire you to work on project forever)
- Liberal contribution reduces burden on individual maintainer
	- A framework for sustainability
- Narrow scope? BDFL could work… 
- Dependent on community and culture
