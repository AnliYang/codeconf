# THE OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTOR FUNNEL

Mike McQuaid, @mikemcquaid, GitHub (Homebrew maintainer)

In which Mike *butchers sales metaphors* :laughing:

- **group your users**
	- users
		- no interaction with you
	- contributors
		- some level of interaction, contributed (detailed) issues
		- may submit PRs, no commit access
	- maintainers
		- commit access
		- interact with community
		- gatekeepers, setting direction of project
- **the funnel**
	- leads -> prospects -> sales
	- users -> contributors -> maintainers
	- Homebrew: 10 active maintainers, 20 over entire lifetime
	- Contributors 1%, maintainers ~.002% (maybe, but Math)
		- This is a decent ratio for the industry
- **upsell**
	- How to *push someone deeper into the funnel*
	- Turn a user into a contributor:
		- E.g. tell them how to open an issue, how to turn a bad issue into a good one (text expander snippet)
		- Push them towards making a PR, point them to docs that walk them through the process, **document your project**, don’t assume people know how to use Git, GitHub, know how to code
	- Turn contributor into a maintainer (someone who has made consistently high quality contributions to the project):
		- New maintainer checklist
- **retain**
	- How will the project attract / repel [users|contributors|maintainers]?
	- Users
		- Care about the project working
		- High quality (maintain quality of project)
		- No guilt merges (don’t merge out of guilt, if the quality just isn’t there)
		- No v2.0 (in Homebrew, ethos of *no 2.0*, i.e. no rewrite, high likelihood of bugs, regressions, missing features introduced by a 2.0)
	- Contributors
		- No *bikeshedding* (low barrier of entry to engagement, conversations people can contribute to)
		- Mailing  list / IRC
		- no feature issues / requests (contentious, Homebrew policy, chances are it won’t get built)
	- Maintainers
		- Code of conduct (hold people accountable to it)
		- Private chat (important to have safety, avoid sense of 5,000 people watching)
		- Always growing (have enough capacity to allow people to take a break)
