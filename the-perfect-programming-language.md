# THE PERFECT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

**Michael R. Bernstein / Code Climate** @mrb_bk

- **Introduction**
	- Box of records
	- Sun Ra, 1968 (jazz composer, performer)
	- FOUND: The Perfect Programming Language by J. Piano :open_mouth:
	- A *perfect* human language can never really exist
	- McCarthy, Lisp
- **The _Perfect_ Language** (J. Piano’s)
	- Semantics
	- Type system
	- Macros
	- Data queries
	- Declarative
	- Concurrency
	- Distributed
	- Object-Oriented
	- Functional
	- Gradual Typing
		- Dynamic script, evolved, enriched over time with types as domain concepts solidify (_Swift_?)
	- Data Types
	- Pattern Matching
	- Data Structures
	- Compiles to a small core language (Haskell -> Hask)
		- OCaml allows you to target intermediary languages, for example
	- Portable
	- Formally verifiable
		- Implementations of algorithms
	- ~~Syntax~~ doesn’t matter, just allow higher level language to compile to this language
- :point_up: **Found in a Notebook** :open_mouth:
- **Would you use this language now?**
	- Why you shouldn’t?
		- It’s not real lolol
		- The *Perfect* programming language doesn’t exist
		- Neither does the *perfect* programming language
	- Constructed (natural) languages, intended to be better than the ones we use
		- A :warning: to us when deciding what languages to use
- The perfect programming language is the one you’re using right now
	- Measured by what they’re capable of creating
	- Even the most maligned languages are capable of creating wonderful things
- How should we measure the success of a language, if not perfection?
	- Languages succeed because of people, and because of the communities around them, that we build and nourish
	- Languages succeed because of the stuff that we build
	- Languages succeed because of the tools we create to support them
- Languages are *not killing themselves to be perfect*, which can infuriate us
	- You’re missing the point if that’s what you’re spending your time focusing on
- We should **not** aim for perfection. If that’s our aim, we should **recalibrate**.
	- When *they* come up with a good idea for their overly complex framework, steal it :laughing:
